      <description>Following on from my first blog post about the changing world of network engineering I thought it would be a good idea to talk about some of the tools and technologies that will form your &amp;lsquo;go to&amp;rsquo; toolkit for network automation.
Just to be clear, this is not a comprehensive list of everything you need to know, nor is it an endorsement of any particular technology over another, this is simply a collection of tools that I use regularly as part of my automation development.</description>

      <description>Below you can find some links to other community content that is worth exploring&amp;hellip;.
CISCO DEVNET
Developer site - https://developer.cisco.com
Sandbox labs - https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/
I really can&amp;rsquo;t recommend this resource enough, Cisco have put together a vast array of training videos and labs to guide you on your automation journey as well as an accompanying sandbox lab enviroment to get hands on experience of all available topics. The best part of all?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m network engineer with over 10 years experience hand cranking networks via the CLI and sometimes the GUI (seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s ok!). in late 2018 I got started with network automation and never looked back, I now spend my time trying to find automated solutions to traditionallly manual problems within the network space. Removing repetition, realising efficiencies and passing on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt to colleagues.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s no getting away from it, the role of the modern network engineer is changing.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping even a cursory eye on recent developments within the networking community, you’ll have done well to avoid terms like NetDevOPs, Infrastructure as code, Network programability and Software Defined Networking.
Make no mistake, network automation is here and it’s here to stay.
Inevitably that realisation can be a little unsettling, it means change, potentially significant change, to an industry that’s remained comfortingly static for the past decade or three.</description>
